                         Wireshark 2.0.0 Release Notes
     __________________________________________________________________

What is Wireshark?

   Wireshark is the world's most popular network protocol analyzer. It is
   used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.
     __________________________________________________________________

What's New

   Wireshark 2.0 features a completely new user interface which should
   provide a smoother, faster user experience. The new interface should be
   familiar to current users of Wireshark but provide a faster workflow
   for many tasks.

   The Windows installer provides the option of installing either the new
   interface ("Wirehsark") or the old interface ("Wireshark Legacy"). Both
   are installed by default. Note that the legacy interface will be
   removed in Wireshark 2.2.

   The OS X installer only provides the new interface. If you need the old
   interface you can install it via Homebrew or MacPorts.

   Wireshark's Debian- and RPM-based package definitions provide the new
   interface in the "wireshark-qt" package and the old interface in the
   "wireshark-gtk" package. It is hoped that downstream distributions will
   follow this convention.

  New File Format Decoding Support

   Wireshark is able to display the format of some types of files (rather
   than displaying the contents of those files). This is useful when
   you're curious about, or debugging, a file and its format. To open a
   capture file (such as PCAP) in this mode specify "MIME Files Format" as
   the file's format in the Open File dialog.

   New files that Wireshark can open in this mode include:

   BTSNOOP, PCAP, and PCAPNG

  Updated Protocol Support

   Too many protocols have been updated to list here.

  New and Updated Capture File Support

   3GPP TS 32.423 Trace, Android Logcat text files, Colasoft Capsa files,
   Netscaler 3.5, and Symbian OS BTSNOOP File Format

   Additionally, Wireshark now supports nanosecond timestamp resolution in
   PCAP-NG files.

  New and Updated Capture Interfaces support

   Androiddump support now provides interfaces to capture (Logcat,
   Bluetooth and WiFi) from connected Android devices.

  Major API Changes

   The libwireshark API has undergone some major changes:
     * The emem framework (including all ep_ and se_ memory allocation
       routines) has been completely removed in favour of wmem which is
       now fully mature.
     * The (long-since-broken) Python bindings support has been removed.
       If you want to write dissectors in something other than C, use Lua.
     * Plugins can now create GUI menu items.
     * Heuristic dissectors can now be globally enabled/disabled so
       heur_dissector_add() has a few more parameters to make that
       possible
     * proto_tree_add_text has been removed.
     * tvb_length() has been removed in favor of tvb_reported_length() and
       tvb_captured_length().
     * The API for ONC RPC-based dissectors has changed significantly: the
       procedure dissectors no longer take an offset, void-argument
       procedures now need to be declared with a function (use
       dissect_rpc_void()), and rpc_init_prog() now handles procedure
       registration too (it takes additional arguments to handle this;
       rpc_init_proc_table() was removed).

Getting Wireshark

   Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
   [12]https://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

  Vendor-supplied Packages

   Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You
   can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management
   system specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can be
   found on the [13]download page on the Wireshark web site.
     __________________________________________________________________

File Locations

   Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for preference
   files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These locations
   vary from platform to platform. You can use About->Folders to find the
   default locations on your system.
     __________________________________________________________________
